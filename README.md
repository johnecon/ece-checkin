Ece-Checkin (outdated)
===========

A Checkin mobile-web app (my bachelor thesis) that combines Facebook, Foursquare and Google Plus. You can have checkins to one or more place from one or more of these three social networks in the same time. There is a mapping algorithm for the places of the different social networks so that they can be displayed properly in the "mixed places" tab. I used sencha touch framework, and deployed it in appengine. Some code is tested with jasmin framework.
